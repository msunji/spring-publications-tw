This is a project I did for [Spring Publications's](https://www.facebook.com/springsbook/) Taiwan distributor. The client's goal was to streamline their operations, transitioning from selling books through LINE and word-of-mouth to a more contemporary, maintanable approach. The main objective for this site was to create a platform to showcase their available inventory whilst also providing a convenient means for customers to place orders.

We decided to go with Airtable to manage their inventory since the client found it to be relatively easy to use. Overall, it was a pretty low-friction integration with Next.js, though not without a few quirks here and there.
